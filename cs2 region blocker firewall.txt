ip Blocker for CS2 regions on a firewall level

Run CMD as Administrator
and copy-paste the following `netsh` commands to block selected regions in CS2.
This will force your client not to establish connections to the selected servers.

Also, you must edit the program location to match your installation of CS2. If your `cs2.exe` is in another location, change the path accordingly.
